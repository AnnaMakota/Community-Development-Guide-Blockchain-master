## **Strategy**

### *To achieve the great goals, to reach the Moon, to create a cutting-edge tech you should be fueled up by the power of the community*.

<font color="gray"> I was excited to accept the challenge at [DApp DEV](https://twitter.com/dapp_dev) ‚Äì to develop the Ethereum devs community in Ukraine from zero to hero, organize the first [Ethereum devs conf in Kyiv‚Äô18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbQDMTrGcmA&t=5s), as well to contribute to the amazing event ‚Äì Berlin Blockchain Week. </font>


There are some links and my thoughts regarding the main activities with examples <strong> to kickstart your community and to commit to the long-term value creation</strong>.

### <font color="green"> SOCIAL MEDIA </font>
‚Ä®‚Ä®
**SMM Strategy**

You should figure out the monthly content-plan, your visual content, as well the tone of voice. The last one mainly is informal, friendly, slightly with the tech buzzwords or jargons and meanwhile discussion-provoking.

**Responding to the questions from your community**.

Interaction, the discussion is the main part of the communication, they are valued more than well-prepared pics.

**Channels**

Choose relevant channels.

For both audiences (techies & non-techies): Telegram, Medium, Twitter.
